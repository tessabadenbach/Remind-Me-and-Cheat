# Remind-Me-and-Cheat
This repository entails the Remind Me and Cheat package

The remind_me() function in this package reminds me of my friends' birthdays. 
With cat(remind_me()), you get a nice list of birthdays as your output.

The cheat() function gives you some solutions to Assignment 3.1R.

This project was created by Theresa Badenbach.
